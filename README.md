# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is determining which machine learning model is better at predicting credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different imbalance correction techniques were used to train the models: over-sampling methods (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE), under-sampling methods (ClusterCentroids), a combination of over- and under-sampling methods (SMOTEEN), and emsemble methods (EasyEnsembleClassifier and BalancedRandomForestClassifier). Subsequently, each model's performance was evaluated by calculating their accuracy score and generating a confusion matrix and imbalanced classification report.
